# ReactNative Weather Search App
This app is used to search the Weather of the city entered in the textbox using Open Weather Search API [https://openweathermap.org/api].

## Basic Requirements:
1. App should use Hourly Forecast, 4-day API format from the Open Weather Search API
2. When the app loads, it provides an interface to type in a search term (for city name). When the user taps on a search button, the API result is shown in a list view on the same page.
3. Each row displays the Date in the header, main weather condition, weather description. Weather image is also lazy-loaded.
4. Show some indication when the app is loading data (Activity indicator in a user- friendly way)
5. The app should handle network/device errors in a decent way.
6. App UI should work well in portrait mode.
7. Show only one row per day. API returns multiple records for each day (every hour). Filter it out and show only one record per day
8. The app should run on both iOS and Android phones.
